                    As part of the team, I am assisting on the new build for Korelogicâ€™s Redbox product using React. I use JavaScript and Typescript to manipulate data on both client and server side and I use GraphQL to query the database. I also assist the designer with user stories, fix bugs and pair program when tackling a difficult challenge.
