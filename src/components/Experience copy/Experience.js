                    <ExperienceDescription>
                    As part of the team, I assisted on the new build for Korelogicâ€™s Redbox product using React. I used JavaScript and Typescript to manipulate data on both client and server side and I used GraphQL to query the database. I also assisted the designer with user stories, fixed bugs and pair programmed when tackling a difficult challenge.
